# SolderingStation2018

I’m an apprentice who works in Switzerland and tried to build the soldering station. 
Unfortunatly it doesen't worked, and i had made some changes. 
I like to offer you the changes that not everyone has to find out them by themself. 

At first the Arduino pro mini with the correct pin assignment couldn’t be delivered, it
was an old version and the companies who sold them, doesn’t deliver anything to
Switzerland. So I draw a new eagle file, I just changed the Arduino mini with
an Arduino Nano. Later when everything worked I made some more changes, the
reset wasn’t connected, added a GND connection and change the connection of the
Potentiometer. 

I found the correct display for the station but the program doesn’t work on the new Arduino
version (1.8.5). But the display needs the new version to work, so I debugged
the program with help from an informatics student. 

Because I changed the Arduino and some other components I also had to change the 3D
components, but with the new version of Inventor I couldn’t import the stl.
files so I draw new ones. 

You could find the Programm, the New Stl. files, the new Arduino board with the shema and a partlist.
